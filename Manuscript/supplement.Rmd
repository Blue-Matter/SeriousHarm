# Summary figures

This section provides for the historical dynamics of the 12 case studies for which the summary figures was not presented in the main text:

(ref:fig-gag) Historical dynamics for SA gag grouper. Time series up to the year of established serious harm (ESH) of (a) spawning biomass (bold line), (b) fishing and natural mortality rate, and (c) recruitment, alongside various LRPs (legend). In stock-recruit panels (d-e), points plot the historical recruitment with the corresponding spawning biomass. Black circles indicate the value for the year of ESH, grey points denote values for antecedent years, and white points for values in subsequent years. The curved line in (d) shows the fitted stock-recruit relationship, with the dotted horizontal corresponding to the recruitment at half of the maximum level, with the corresponding biomass, $SB_{0.5\textrm{Rmax}}$, at the vertical dashed line. Dotted lines in panel (e) indicate the 90th percentile of recruitment (horizontal line) and the 90th percentile replacement line (diagonal line). The intersection is the $SB_{0.9R/S}$ reference point (dashed vertical line). Panel (f) is a phase plot of surplus production over time, with the vertical, dashed line indicating a biomass threshold for serious harm below which there is very low to no surplus production.
